# Project-Euler
Using the project euler problems (https://projecteuler.net) to practice on a new programming language.

Every problem has a subfolder with a txt which describes it.\
Every programming language for problem has its subfolder.\
Every solution per language could have its subfolder or it could be inside the main code file.

e.g.

main directory for problem 1: 
- /problem-001
- /problem-001/problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5.txt

subfolders for different languages:
- /problem-001/Python/
- /problem-001/Kotlin/
- /problem-001/C#/
